# Personalised Workout Routine Generator
A Python-based command-line application that generates personalized weekly workout routines based on user input, including fitness level, workout intensity, available time, and physical measurements.
## Features

User Input Collection: Gathers user details such as current weight, height, goal weight, fitness level, workout intensity, weekly workout days, session duration, and calorie intake.
Unit Conversion: Supports input in kg/feet, pounds/meters, or kg/meters with automatic conversion to kg and meters.
Customized Workouts: Generates tailored routines with exercises suited to Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced fitness levels.
Time Management: Adjusts exercise durations to fit the user's specified workout time per session.
Randomized Routines: Creates varied daily workout plans for the specified number of days (1-7) with random exercise selection and durations.
Input Validation: Ensures all inputs are valid numbers within acceptable ranges.

## Requirements

Python 3.x
Standard library: random

## How to Run

Clone or download the repository.

Navigate to the project directory.

### Run the script:
python workout_generator.py


### Follow the prompts to:

Enter weight, height, and goal weight with preferred units (kg/feet, pound/m, kg/m).
Select workout intensity (Casual, Average, Hardcore).
Choose fitness level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
Specify number of workout days per week (1-7).
Enter workout session duration in minutes.
Provide average daily calorie intake.
View the generated weekly workout routine.



## Gameplay

Fitness Levels and Exercises:
Beginner: Bodyweight Squats, Push Ups, Treadmill Walking, Plank Hold, etc.
Intermediate: Barbell Back Squats, Bench Press, Pull Ups, Mountain Climbers, etc.
Advanced: Barbell Deadlifts, Clean and Press, Box Jumps, Pistol Squats, etc.


## Workout Structure:
Routines are generated for the specified number of days (e.g., Monday to Wednesday for 3 days).
Each day includes 1 or more exercises with durations adjusted to fit the userâ€™s available time.
Exercise durations vary based on session length (e.g., 1-5 min for short sessions, 2-15 min for longer ones).


Output: Displays a weekly plan with exercises and their durations for each workout day.
